## üåü Features

- **Raydium Integration**: Simulate and execute transactions with optimal configurations.
- **Dynamic CLI Options**: User-friendly command-line interface for greater control.
- **Volume Simulation**: Pre-calculates Jito tips and 5bps fees for accuracy.
- **Efficient Keypair Management**: Automates SOL/WSOL distribution across keypairs.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging to troubleshoot transaction issues.
- **Customizable Time Intervals**: Ensures transaction authenticity through dynamic delays.
- **Fund Recovery**: Streamlines consolidation of remaining SOL/WSOL back to the wallet.

---

## üõ† Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
- **npm** (v6+ recommended)
- **A Solana Wallet**: Ensure it is funded with enough SOL for transaction fees and operations.
- **Environment Variables**: Configure an `.env` file with your wallet private key and Solana RPC URL.

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/raydium-volume-bot-v3.git
   cd raydium-volume-bot-v3
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create and configure a `.env` file:

   ```env
   RPC_URL=https://your-rpc-url
   WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=[your,private,key,array]
   ```

---

## üöÄ Usage

Start the bot by running:

```bash
npm start
```

### CLI Features

- **Generate Keypairs**:  
  Command: `npm run keypair-gen`  
  Use this to create fresh keypairs for your transaction workflow.

- **Distribute SOL/WSOL**:  
  Command: `npm run distribute --amount=<SOL_AMOUNT>`  
  Allocates SOL or WSOL to keypairs for efficient transaction processing.

- **Simulate Volume**:  
  Command: `npm run simulate --volume=<VOLUME_AMOUNT>`  
  Calculates fees and ensures sufficient SOL allocation.

- **Execute Transactions**:  
  Command: `npm run execute --volume=<VOLUME_AMOUNT>`  
  Starts the transaction process with defined parameters.

- **Recover Funds**:  
  Command: `npm run recover`  
  Consolidates remaining SOL/WSOL back to your wallet.

## üíª Workflow Explanation

1. **Keypair Management**:  
   Generate distinct keypairs for each transaction cycle, ensuring separation of activities.

2. **SOL/WSOL Allocation**:  
   Allocate between 0.05 and 1 SOL per keypair for gas fees.

3. **Volume Simulation**:  
   Pre-calculates Jito tip fees and Raydium 5bps charges to ensure accurate volume execution.

4. **Transaction Execution**:  
   Runs high-volume transactions with time intervals (2-10 seconds) to mimic natural activity.

5. **Fund Recovery**:  
   Consolidates unused funds into the main wallet for efficient reuse.

---

## üèÜ Best Practices

- Use fresh keypairs for each transaction workflow.
- Simulate fees to avoid transaction failures due to insufficient SOL.
- Maintain time intervals between transactions for authenticity.
- Consolidate funds regularly to minimize scattered balances.
- Monitor network conditions to adjust priority fees dynamically.
